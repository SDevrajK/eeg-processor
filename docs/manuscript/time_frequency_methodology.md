## Time-Frequency Representation Computation

Time-frequency decomposition of EEG epochs was performed using Morlet wavelets to obtain complex-valued representations of oscillatory activity across time and frequency dimensions. The complex time-frequency representation W(f,t) was computed by convolving each EEG epoch with complex Morlet wavelets at logarithmically spaced frequencies, with the number of cycles per wavelet automatically scaled as f/2 to balance temporal and spectral resolution across the frequency range. From this complex representation, spectral power was derived as the squared magnitude |W(f,t)|Â², providing a measure of oscillatory amplitude at each time-frequency point. Inter-trial coherence (ITC) was computed as the magnitude of the trial-averaged complex representation normalized by individual trial magnitudes: ITC(f,t) = |E[W(f,t)/|W(f,t)|]|, where E[] denotes the expectation operator across trials, providing a measure of phase consistency across trials that is independent of power fluctuations. For computational efficiency with large datasets, single-trial baseline correction was applied to power values before trial averaging using a chunked processing approach to minimize memory usage, ensuring that baseline-corrected power reflects relative changes in oscillatory activity while preserving the mathematical integrity of both power and phase-based measures.
